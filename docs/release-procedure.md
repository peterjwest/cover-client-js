# Release procedure

Kick off the release process by using `yarn create-release`. This will ask you what level of release this is (patch, minor or major) in order to correctly increment the version number. It will then automatically generate a changelog and create a Pull Request. You will need the GitHub CLI tool [`hub`](https://hub.github.com) installed and configured.
